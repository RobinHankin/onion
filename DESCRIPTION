Title: Octonions and Quaternions
LazyData: TRUE
Author: Robin K. S. Hankin
Description:
  Quaternions and Octonions are four- and eight- dimensional
  extensions of the complex numbers.  They are normed division
  algebras over the real numbers and find applications in spatial
  rotations (quaternions) and string theory and relativity
  (octonions).  The quaternions are noncommutative and the octonions
  nonassociative.  See the package vignette for more details.
